<p>In some situations of application development process there is a need to set up ( inject) values into the bean properties. There are different ways of injection process. We can create XML file to inject value for properties of bean. or we can set
  the value for property with <cb>@value</cb> annotation in a bean class.</p>
<p>To use XML based configuration method we need to create .xml file to configure bean and then we need to intialize <cb>ClassPathXmlApplicationContext</cb> context by passing bean configured xml file.</p>

  <xmp>ClassPathXmlApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(
    "applicationContext.xml");
    MyService app = context.getBean(MyService.class);</xmp>
